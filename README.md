## 2. Values and References
### The final keyword.
When we say that the final Keyword means that a variable can only be assigned once, what we mean is that when the variable in this stack is assigned to an object in the heap, then we can't change which object in the heap this variable points to. The final Keyword stops us doing that. But we can change the object in the heap if we wish


## 6. Tuning the Virtual Machine
```
-verbose:gc
```
 We know that you can check this using the Visual VM application, but if you want a quicker way just to monitor it, this might be useful. The argument is -verbose:gc. The verbose argument does have some other options you can output, but these aren't related to memory or garbage collection so I'm not going to cover those here. You can read the Java docs if you're interested. Just to see this one in action, I've come up with some simple code. You could pause the video and type this in if you'd like. It's not too exciting. What I've got is an array of customers and then a never ending loop that adds a new customer to the array. If the number of items in the array is going to the one hundred, then it removes 10 of the customers from the array. So we'll be, every so often, removing 10 items at a time. Those 10 items will then be eligible for garbage collection. I expect if we run this with a reasonably small heap, that we should see some garbage collections happening relatively frequently. If we right-click on the application, and do Run As and Run configurations, I think that option's just off-screen, and in the arguments I've typed in here a 10 megabyte heap, I want it to be very small. Then here's by -verbose:gc argument. So if we run this now, it's not terribly exciting. In fact you can see we've already had two garbage collections straight away. My application is still running. I imagine we will get another one in a moment. Then we've had a couple more now. And in fact they're becoming more frequent. So I guess that my application is probably starting to run out of space. If you're trying to fine tune your application, you might want to alter the size of the young generation. That is, how much of the heap is occupied by the young generation versus the old generation. By default the young generation is set to be a third of the total heap size. If your application, like the one we've just seen, has very few objects that are going to survive into the old generation, you might want to increase the size of the young generation. Oracle recommends that you size your young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall heap size. The option to set the size of the young generation is the argument -Xmn. This works just like the other - Xmx and -Xms arguments we've just seen. For example, if you wanted to set the young generation to 256 megabytes, you'd issue the command -Xmn256m. Note that this option sets the total size and the initial size of the young generation at the same time. So in this example you'd need your overall heap size and your initial heap size to both be sufficiently greater than this figure. If you set your initial heap size to be 512m, then when your application starts, half the heap will be for the young generation.
```
-Xmn256m 
```
